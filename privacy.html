    <h2>💬 Story Sharing</h2>
    <p>When you share a story, your name, email, and any other identifying data are <strong>not collected</strong>. All stories are stored anonymously using Google Firestore.</p>

    <h2>📄 Harassment Reports</h2>
    <p>The report form is powered by <strong>Google Forms</strong>, and it's set to <strong>NOT collect email addresses or logins</strong>. No response receipts. No IP logs. Just your voice.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Who Can See This?</h2>
    <p>Only the SheCode team will be able to view the backend data. Your identity stays between you and your truth.</p>

    <h2>🛑 You Control the Narrative</h2>
    <p>You are never required to share anything you’re not ready to. This is YOUR space, YOUR story, YOUR boundaries.</p>
